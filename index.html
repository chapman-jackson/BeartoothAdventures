            <h2>Beartooth Mountains Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Beartooth Mountain Range spans through parts of southern Montana and northern Wyoming.</p>
            <p>
                The Beartooth Highway is a popular stretch of road that was paved    through the Beartooth Mountain Range.
                It offers breathtaking views of the mountains, with plenty of pullouts where you can stop and go on a hike, ski down a hill, or simply enjoy the scenery.
                Depending on the season, you might see waterfalls cascading from snowcaps, and if you're lucky, you might spot mountain goats grazing.
                The highway also leads to the north entrance of Yellowstone National Park, which is one of the most popular National Parks in the United States.

            <h2>Site Content</h2>
            <p>On this site, you will find information about animals you might encounter, geographical features to see, and how to stay safe while exploring the mountain range.</p>
            <p>On the Get Road Closure Alerts page, you can sign up to receive alerts for when the Department of Transportation closes Beartooth Highway. The highway can close for a variety of reasons, such as receiving 20 feet of snowfall, landslides, or flooding that destroys sections of the road.</p>
